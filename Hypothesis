Hypothesis: Obesity or ailment caused or retaled to obesity is positively correlated with increased risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. This may be due to the fact that obesity is associated with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which are known risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, obesity may impair immune function and increase inflammation, making individuals more susceptible to severe COVID-19 infections. Therefore, it is hypothesized that obesity is a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalization and death.

Obesity is positively associated with increased COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations. Specifically, individuals with obesity may experience more severe COVID-19 symptoms, require more hospitalization, and have a higher mortality rate compared to non-obese individuals. This hypothesis is based on previous research that has shown that obesity is a risk factor for other respiratory illnesses and may also impact immune function, which could increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, obesity is associated with several comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, which are also risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.
